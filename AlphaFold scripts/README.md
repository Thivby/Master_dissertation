# AlphaFold Scripts

This folder contains SLURM batch scripts and job preparation templates used to run AlphaFold Multimer on the Flemish Supercomputer (VSC). Scripts here include:

- `submit_all_jobs.sh`: batch job submission
- `basic_js.sh`: generic AlphaFold wrapper
- `my_js.sh`: custom job variations

Edit the paths and FASTA filenames in each script to match your environment before use.
