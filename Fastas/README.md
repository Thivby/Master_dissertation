# FASTA Files for AlphaFold

This folder contains protein FASTA files used as inputs for AlphaFold Multimer runs. Subfolders are organized by the date of prediction runs (e.g., `070225_1`, `240425`), and some loose FASTA files are stored directly here.

Each FASTA includes one or more protein sequences (constructs or interactors), used to model pairwise or modular interactions.
