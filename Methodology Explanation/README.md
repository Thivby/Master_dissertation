# Methodology Explanation

Jupyter notebooks in this folder explain the computational strategies used, including:

- Cut-off determination methods (Sala and own) with generation of supporting plots
- Composite scoring logic
- Enrichment and peptide normalization


These notebooks act as the computational foundation of the thesis.
